// manual

- search doesn't work
- fix the logo
- fix the image

// auto

- roll 20 is dobby. change the name, image, hometown and all relavant data.
- modals don't always have to be full screen. it can be only to a certain screen width. it looks very big now.
- handle the scrollbar styles, it's getting messy.
- more things can be added to the owl posts and contact. in fact these sections can be sperated.
- i'd love if i didn't need to scroll to reach the contact buttons.
- the clear all button can be put in the beginning instead of the end.
- we need a scroll to top button
- final refactor and commit to git. no more today.
